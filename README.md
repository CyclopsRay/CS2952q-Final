## Modified VOneNet very Robust
This project is build based on CS2470 research, the foolproof eyes. In extend to it, we build another diffusion model and incorperate them together to genereate a better robustness result.
E stands for EfficientNet.
V stands for VOneNet.
D stands for Diffusion Model.
